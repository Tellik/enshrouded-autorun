# mod.json, your mod's information card

Every mod needs a `mod.json`. ShroudForge reads it before preparing or starting a mod. The file describes the mod and the capabilities it requests.

## Required fields

`id`, `name`, and `version` are required. Every other field is optional. Each property has its own page in this group.

## The file described here

The canonical schema is [manifest.schema.json](https://bonsaibauer.github.io/shroudforge/schemas/manifest.schema.json). The loader also checks dependencies and runtime conditions in [read_mod_manifest.rs](https://github.com/bonsaibauer/shroudforge/blob/HEAD/modules/modloader/read_mod_manifest.rs).

## A small example

```json
{
  "id": "example.hello-ember",
  "name": "Hello Ember",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "authors": ["Your Name"],
  "capabilities": ["runtime"],
  "dependencies": []
}
```
